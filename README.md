*** Pyint ***

Pyint is the graphic software which is made with Python.
Also it is based on Turtle graphics.
The name 'Pyint' is compound word of 'Python' and 'Paint'

I got inspiration from the MS Winodws' graphic software - MSPaint.
So, I am trying to make my own graphic sofrware with this project.

There are two keywords in Pyint. 'Simple' & 'Easy'
I aim to make this program likes its design simply.
Also, I want to make it as easy as possible.

The whole source code will be open source

Enjoy :)
