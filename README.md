*** Pyint ***

Pyint is the graphic software which is made with Python.
Also it is based on Turtle graphics.
The name 'Pyint' is compound word of 'Python' and 'Paint'

I got inspiration from the MS Winodws' graphic software - MSPaint.
And Make my own graphic sofrware is one of my goals through this project.

'Simple' & 'Easy' are keywords of Pyint.
So, 'Design Simple, Easy to handle' is the motto of it.

Enjoy :)
