## About Pyint

Pyint is the graphic software which is written in Python(I use the Turtle graphics).

The name 'Pyint' is compound word of 'Python' and 'Paint'

It inspired from the MS Winodws' graphic software - MSPaint.

'Simple' & 'Ease' are keywords of Pyint.

So, 'Design Simple, Easy to handle' is the motto of this project.

## Downloads and Running MonteCrisoLab Pyint

Download file from the [Pyint GitHub release page.](https://github.com/Johndoe0153/Pyint/releases)
After download, please run the file, and then you can use the Pyint.

### Requirements

- Microsoft Windows 7 or newer.
 
 - I just checked that the Pyint can run on Windows 7 and 10. So I'm not sure about Pyint works on other version of Windows(likes XP or 8)
  But I can say the Pyint only supports Winodows... So I think this is the only reuquirements of Pyint.

### How to use Pyint?

Pyint is easy to use.

You can use Pyint with mouse, but some fuctions can use with typing commands.

Now here are some commands that you know:

pu: Pen Up. If you type 'pu', pen will not draw the line.

pd: Pen down. If you type 'pu', pen will draw the line. Use it after you type 'pu'.

h: Home. Use it when you want to the pen comes on the basic position(0,0).

z: Undo. It works similar likes 'Ctrl + Z'

es: Enter to settings. You can change colors of pen and background.

ss: Save and exit from the settings. ⚠️ If you changed the setting, don' forget type 'ss'. If you didn't you should type settings AGAIN :(

gg: Close the program. Type 'gg' and if you really want to close, type 'y'.
