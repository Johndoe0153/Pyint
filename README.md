## About Pyint

Pyint is the graphic software which is written in Python(I use the Turtle graphics).

The name 'Pyint' is compound word of 'Python' and 'Paint'

It inspired from the MS Winodws' graphic software - MSPaint.

'Simpleness' & 'Ease' are keywords of Pyint.

So, 'Design Simple, Easy to use' is the motto of this project.

## Downloads and Running MonteCrisoLab Pyint

Download file from the [Pyint GitHub release page.](https://github.com/Johndoe0153/Pyint/releases)
After download, please run the file, and then you can use the Pyint.

### Requirements

- Microsoft Windows 7 or newer.
 
 - I just checked that the Pyint can run on Windows 7 and 10. So I'm not sure about Pyint works on other version of Windows(likes XP or 8)
  But I can say the Pyint only supports Winodows... So I think this is the only reuquirements of Pyint.

### How to use Pyint?

Pyint is easy to use.

You can use Pyint with mouse, but some fuctions can use with typing commands.

Click the left mouse button and draw. If you click the right mouse button on where you want, pen will move.

And if you click the left mouse button again, you can keep draw.

#### Now here are some commands that you know:

h: Home. Use it when you want to the pen comes on the basic position(0,0).
