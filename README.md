*** Pyint ***

Pyint is the graphic software which is made with Python.
Also it is based on Turtle graphics.

The name 'Pyint' is compound word of 'Python' and 'Paint'
I got inspiration from the MS Winodws' graphic software - MSPaint.

'Simple' & 'Ease' are keywords of Pyint.
So, 'Design Simple, Easy to handle' is the motto of this project.

Enjoy :)
