## About Pyint

Pyint is the graphic software which is written in Python(I use the Turtle graphics).

The name 'Pyint' is compound word of 'Python' and 'Paint'

It inspired from the MS Winodws' graphic software - MSPaint.

'Simple' & 'Ease' are keywords of Pyint.

So, 'Design Simple, Easy to handle' is the motto of this project.

## How to use?

Pyint is easy to use. Just type the command and press 'Enter'!!

basically control with 'WASD'
For example, if you want to move pen forward, just type 'w' and press 'Enter' key.

### And now here is additional fucion with type those:

q: Turn the pen to the left(it will turns in 45 degrees).

r: Turn the turtle to the right(it also turns 45 degrees).

es: Enter to settings. You can change colors of pen and background.

ss: Save and exit from the settings. If you changed the setting, type it.

gg: Close the program.For end up this program, type 'gg' and you will come out from the program
